# Frameworks

Also referred to as “CSS frameworks,” these are packages containing pre-written, standardized code in files and folders. They give you a base to build on while still allowing flexibility with the final design. Typically, front-end frameworks contain the following components:
- A grid which makes it simple to organize the design elements of your website
- Defined font styles and sizing that varies based on its function (different typography for headings versus paragraphs, etc.)
- Pre-built website components like side panels, buttons, and navigation bars
Depending on the specific framework you choose, there’s a lot more they are capable of as well.
